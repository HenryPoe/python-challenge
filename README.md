# Python-challenge

## PyBank

* In this challenge, there is a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
	There is a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). 
	The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
## PyPoll

* In this challenge, there is a Python script to help a small town count all the votes in an election.
	There is a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv).
	The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

* The Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
